# 🌐 GitHub Pages Deployment with GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates a simple Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflow using **GitHub Actions** to automatically deploy a static website to **GitHub Pages**.

## 🚀 What It Does

- Hosts a simple `index.html` page that says:  
  **"Hello, GitHub Actions!"**
- Automatically deploys the site to GitHub Pages **only when** `index.html` is changed and pushed to the `main` branch.
- Utilizes GitHub Actions for automation and GitHub Pages for free static hosting.
